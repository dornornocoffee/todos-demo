# Angular Todos

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 18.2.14. This project is about todo-list web demo which I learned from the tutorial.

The style of this web demo was made by **Monsterlessons Academy**. I only used it for educational propose.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
